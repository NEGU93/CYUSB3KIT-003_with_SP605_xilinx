USB ISOLOOP-AUTO EXAMPLE
-------------------------

  This example illustrates the use of the FX3 firmware APIs to implement
  a data loopback application over a pair of USB isochronous endpoints.

  The device enumerates as a vendor specific USB device with a pair of isochronous
  endpoints (3-OUT and 3-IN).  The application loops back any data that it
  receives on the isochronous OUT endpoint on the isochronous IN endpoint.

  The mult settings is enabled only for USB SS and USB HS operations.
  USB FS functions with a smaller EP size and single packet per microframe.

  The loopback is achieved with the help of a DMA AUTO channel which is
  created connecting the two endpoints.  There is no FX3 CPU involvement
  in the data transfer, and the loopback is performed automatically by the
  FX3 device hardware.
