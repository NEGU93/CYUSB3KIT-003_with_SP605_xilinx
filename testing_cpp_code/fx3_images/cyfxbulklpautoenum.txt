USB BULKLOOP-AUTO NORMAL ENUMERATION EXAMPLE
-------------------------

  This example illustrates the use of the FX3 firmware APIs to implement
  a data loopback application over a pair of USB bulk endpoints.

  The device enumerates as a vendor specific USB device with a pair of bulk
  endpoints (1-OUT and 1-IN).  The application loops back any data that it
  receives on the bulk OUT endpoint on the bulk IN endpoint.

  The loopback is achieved with the help of a DMA AUTO channel which is
  created connecting the two endpoints.  There is no FX3 CPU involvement
  in the data transfer, and the loopback is performed automatically by the
  FX3 device hardware.

  This example uses normal enumeration. All setup packets are handled by
  the application.
