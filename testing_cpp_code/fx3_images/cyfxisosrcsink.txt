USB ISO SOURCE SINK EXAMPLE
-------------------------------

  This example illustrates the use of the FX3 firmware APIs to implement
  a data source and data sink over a pair of USB Iso endpoints.

  The device enumerates as a vendor specific USB device with a pair of Iso
  endpoints (3-OUT and 3-IN). The OUT endpoint acts as data sink and the IN
  endpoint acts as data source to the PC Host.

  The source and sink is achieved with the help of a a DMA MANUAL_IN channel 
  and a DMA MANUAL_OUT channel. Any data received from the host through the 
  DMA MANUAL_IN channel is discarded. A constant data pattern is continuously
  loaded into the DMA MANUAL_OUT channel and sent to the host.
