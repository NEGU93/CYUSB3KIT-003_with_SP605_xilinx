USB ISOLOOP-MANUAL_IN_OUT EXAMPLE
-------------------------------

  This is another variant of the USB isochronous loopback application that
  shows the use of the ARM9 CPU as a source or sink for data exchanged with
  the USB host.
  
  Though the functionality implemented is the same as the other loopback
  examples, the implementation is different. In this case, the data received
  on the 3-OUT endpoint is received by the firmware application, copied into
  another data buffer and then sent to the USB host through the 3-IN endpoint.

  Two separate DMA channels are used to implement the data path for the two
  endpoints, and there is no connectivity established at the hardware level
  between the two endpoints.
